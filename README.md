# Smart Static Site

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website infrastructure on AWS using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with TypeScript. It provisions key AWS services including:

- An S3 bucket for static website hosting  
- A CloudFront distribution to deliver content globally with low latency  
- An AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate to enable HTTPS security

The project serves as a learning and testing ground for infrastructure-as-code practices, helping to understand how to define, build, and deploy cloud resources programmatically.

It is intended primarily for experimentation and skill development with AWS CDK and cloud infrastructure automation.
